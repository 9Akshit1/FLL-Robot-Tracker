Motion timeline (what this fake data represents)

Sampling: every 50 ms
Total duration: ~15 seconds (~300 rows)

Time(s) = Motion
0–2	= stationary (encoder jitter only)
2–6	= drive straight
6–9	= smooth left turn
9–11 = arm/finger movement only
11–14 = drive + small arm corrections
14–15 = stop & settle
